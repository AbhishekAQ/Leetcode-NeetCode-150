"""
Encode and Decode Strings

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string and decode it back to the list of strings.

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["lint","code","love","you"]
Output: ["lint","code","love","you"]

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["we","say",":","yes"]
Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]

Constraints:
1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] contains any possible characters out of 256 valid ascii characters.
