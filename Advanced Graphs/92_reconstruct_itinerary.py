Reconstruct Itinerary

You are given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to]. Reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Return the itinerary that uses all the tickets once and only once. If there are multiple valid itineraries, return the lexicographically smallest one.

Example:
Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]

Constraints:
1 <= tickets.length <= 300
from.length == to.length == 3
tickets[i][0] and tickets[i][1] are airport codes
All tickets are valid.
