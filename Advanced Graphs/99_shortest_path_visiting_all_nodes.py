Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes

You are given an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1. Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, revisit nodes multiple times, and reuse edges.

Example:
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
Output: 4

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 12
graph.length == n
0 <= graph[i].length < n
0 <= graph[i][j] < n
