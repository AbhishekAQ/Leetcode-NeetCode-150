Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges, return the number of connected components in the graph.

Example:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2000
0 <= edges.length <= 5000
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= edges[i][j] <= n - 1
