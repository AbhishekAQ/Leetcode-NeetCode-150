Minimum Height Trees

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. Given such a tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of edges, return all the root labels of minimum height trees.

Example:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [1]

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
edges.length == n - 1
0 <= ai, bi < n
ai != bi
