Combination Sum

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target.

Example 1:
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]

Constraints:
1 <= candidates.length <= 30
1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
All elements of candidates are distinct.
1 <= target <= 500
