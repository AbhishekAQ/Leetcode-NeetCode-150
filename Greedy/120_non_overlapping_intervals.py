Non-overlapping Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5
intervals[i].length == 2
-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4
