Insert Interval

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] sorted by starti and an interval newInterval = [start, end]. Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted by starti and non-overlapping (merge if necessary).

Example:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]

Constraints:
0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4
newInterval.length == 2
