Minimum Interval to Include Each Query

You are given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] and an array of queries. For each query, find the minimum interval from intervals that includes the query. Return an array of answers for each query.

Example:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,3,3,-1]

Constraints:
1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5
intervals[i].length == 2
1 <= starti <= endi <= 10^7
1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
1 <= queries[i] <= 10^7
