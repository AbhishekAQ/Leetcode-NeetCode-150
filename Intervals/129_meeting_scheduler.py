You are given two lists of availability intervals for two people. Each interval is a pair of start and end times. Find the earliest time slot that works for both people and is at least the given duration.

Example:
Input: slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 8
Output: [60,68]

Constraints:
1 <= slots1.length, slots2.length <= 10^4
slots1[i].length == slots2[j].length == 2
0 <= starti < endi <= 10^9
1 <= duration <= 10^6
