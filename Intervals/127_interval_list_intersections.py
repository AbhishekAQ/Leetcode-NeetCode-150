Interval List Intersections

You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order. Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

Example:
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

Constraints:
0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000
firstList[i].length == secondList[j].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^9
