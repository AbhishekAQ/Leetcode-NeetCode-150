Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection, return null.

Example 1:
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5]
Output: Intersected at '8'

Example 2:
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5]
Output: No intersection

Constraints:
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 10^5].
-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
