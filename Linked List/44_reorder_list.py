Given the head of a singly linked list, reorder the list as follows: L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
