LRU Cache

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Example 1:
Input: ["LRUCache","put","put","get","put","get","put","get","get","get"], [[2],[1,1],[2,2],[1],[3,3],[2],[4,4],[1],[3],[4]]
Output: [null,null,null,1,null,-1,null,-1,3,4]

Constraints:
1 <= capacity <= 3000
0 <= key <= 3000
0 <= value <= 10^4
At most 2 * 10^5 calls will be made to get and put.
