Copy List with Random Pointer

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null. Return a deep copy of the list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Example 2:
Input: head = [[],[]]
Output: []

Constraints:
0 <= n <= 1000
-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
