Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

You are given n cities numbered from 0 to n-1 and a list of flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]. You are also given src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

Example:
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= flights.length <= 400
flights[i].length == 3
0 <= fromi, toi < n
fromi != toi
1 <= pricei <= 10^4
0 <= src, dst, k < n
