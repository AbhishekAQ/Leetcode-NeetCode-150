Graph Valid Tree

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges, write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

Example:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]
Output: true

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2000
0 <= edges.length <= 5000
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= edges[i][j] <= n - 1
