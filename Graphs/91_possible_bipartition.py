"""
Possible Bipartition

Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not be in the same group. Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

Example:
Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 2000
0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000
dislikes[i].length == 2
1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N
All pairs of dislikes are unique.
