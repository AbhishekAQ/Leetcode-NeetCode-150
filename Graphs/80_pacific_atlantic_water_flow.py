Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

Given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, return a list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean.

Example:
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]

Constraints:
m == heights.length
n == heights[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= heights[i][j] <= 10^5
