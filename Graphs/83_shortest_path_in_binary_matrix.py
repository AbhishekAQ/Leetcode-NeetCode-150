Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.
A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (0, 0) to the bottom-right cell (n - 1, n - 1) such that:
All visited cells are 0.
All cells adjacent (8-directionally) to the path are either 0 or 1.

Example:
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2

Constraints:
n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
