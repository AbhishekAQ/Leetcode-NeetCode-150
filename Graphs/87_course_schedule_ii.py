Course Schedule II

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1. Some courses may have prerequisites, given as pairs [a, b] meaning you must take course b before course a. Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible, return an empty array.

Example:
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]

Constraints:
1 <= numCourses <= 2000
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
All the pairs are unique.
