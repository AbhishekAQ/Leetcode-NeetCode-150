Network Delay Time

You are given a network of n nodes, labeled 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target. Return the time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible, return -1.

Example:
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= times.length <= 6000
times[i].length == 3
1 <= u, v <= n
0 <= w <= 100
