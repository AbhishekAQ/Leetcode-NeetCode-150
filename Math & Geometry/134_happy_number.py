Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy. A happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit repeatedly. If it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1, it is not happy.

Example:
Input: n = 19
Output: true

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
