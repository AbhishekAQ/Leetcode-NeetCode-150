Unique Paths II

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

Example:
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2

Constraints:
m == obstacleGrid.length
n == obstacleGrid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1
