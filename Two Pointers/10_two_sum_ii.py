Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Return the indices of the two numbers.

Example 1:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]

Example 3:
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]

Constraints:
2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
-1000 <= target <= 1000
Only one valid answer exists.
