K Closest Points to Origin

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[3,4],[2,-1]], k = 2
Output: [[1,3],[2,-1]]

Constraints:
1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
-10^4 < xi, yi < 10^4
