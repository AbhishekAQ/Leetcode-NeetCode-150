Find Median from Data Stream

The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. Design a data structure that supports adding numbers and finding the median.

Example 1:
Input: ["MedianFinder","addNum","addNum","findMedian"], [[],[1],[2],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,1.5]

Example 2:
Input: ["MedianFinder","addNum","addNum","addNum","findMedian"], [[],[2],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,3]

Constraints:
-10^5 <= num <= 10^5
At most 5 * 10^4 calls will be made to addNum and findMedian.
