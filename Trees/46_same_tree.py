Same Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Constraints:
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
