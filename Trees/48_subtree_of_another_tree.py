Subtree of Another Tree

Given two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [1], subRoot = [1]
Output: true

Constraints:
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [1, 2000].
-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
