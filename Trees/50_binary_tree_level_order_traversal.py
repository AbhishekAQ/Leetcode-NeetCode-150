Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
