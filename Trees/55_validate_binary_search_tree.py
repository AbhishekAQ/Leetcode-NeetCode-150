Validate Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
