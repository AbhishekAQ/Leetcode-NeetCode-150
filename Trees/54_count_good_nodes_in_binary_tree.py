Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, return the number of good nodes in the tree. A node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
