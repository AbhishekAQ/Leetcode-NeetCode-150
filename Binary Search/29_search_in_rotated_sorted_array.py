Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
All values of nums are unique.
