"""
Time Based Key-Value Store

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Example 1:
Input: ["TimeMap","set","get","get"], [["foo","bar",1],["foo",1],["foo",3]]
Output: [null,null,"bar","bar"]

Constraints:
1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100
1 <= timestamp <= 10^7
All the values timestamp are strictly increasing.
